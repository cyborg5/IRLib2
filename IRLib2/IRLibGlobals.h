 * This file replaces the previous IRLibRData.h file. It contains definition of global
 * items which are used by both the receiver and decoding classes. They have to be
 * declared global in scope because they are accessed by the ISR and you cannot pass
 * parameters nor objects to an ISR routine.
 *
 * In general, applications would not include this file. Unless you are creating your own
 * customized receiver class apart from the provided IRrcev, IRrcevPCI, or IRrcevLoop
 * classes, you can ignore the contents of this file.
 * The RECV_BUF_LENGTH is the only item you would ever modify unless you are completely
 * rewriting how the system works in general.

/****  NOTE CONCERNING BUFFER NAMES AND VOLATILITY
 * In versions of IRLib prior to 2.0 we had the capability to declare an external
 * buffer so that the receiver could resume receiving while the decoding was taking place.
 * However it was up to the decoder to notice that the data had been received via a call to
 * getResults() and it had to tell the receiver to resume. Starting with version 2.0
 * it is now possible that the receiver can automatically copy the data to the external
 * buffer and auto resume. Rather than using names like rawbuf1 and rawbuf2 we have come
 * up with a new naming system. Also irparams wasn't the most descriptive name
 * ever conceived. Here is our new naming system which we hope is slightly less confusing.
 *
 * First irparams was a structure that contained global variables used by the receiver ISR.
 * They should not be part of the receiver class because you can't pass parameters
 * to an ISR. We think recvGlobal is a better name.
 *
 * Previously the ISR did not need access to any external buffer so it only needed one
 * buffer and one length variable. If there was an external buffer, only the decoder
 * needed to access it. Now the receiver and ISR needs access to that external buffer
 * in order to implement auto resume. Therefore the extra buffer needs to be linked
 * to recvGlobal as well. The receiver puts the data in recvGlobal.recvBuffer and it's 
 * length is in recvGlobal.recvLength. It is for the receiver's internal use.
 * Additionally we have "decodeBuffer" and "decodeLength" which
 * are defined as where the decoder wants the receiver to put its data. The decoder
 * decides where decodeBuffer points. The receiver puts the data at that address
 * and has no idea where it points. The receiver puts the length in decodeLength.
 * It is the receiver's responsibility to copy the data from recvBuffer to decodeBuffer.
 * The math is always done in getResults however deciding when to do the copying is
 * a bit more complicated. If we are doing auto resume, we do a bufcpy to copy as
 * quickly as possible and defer the math until the actual poll to getResults.
 * The getResults needs to know whether it should copy or just do the math in place.
 * If you determine that by the flag didAutoResume.
 *
 * Now we tackle the volatile issue of "volatile". Aptly named because it starts flame wars.
 * In general the rule is, if data is to be accessed inside and outside an ISR you need to
 * add the volatile qualifier to its definition. This ensures that the compiler does not
 * optimize the code in such a way that a bad copy of a variable might be used. It forces
 * the compiler to fetch the data every time he uses it and not to store it in a register.
 * We are going to presume that our ISRs never interrupt themselves. I believe the volatile
 * qualifier may not be necessary because the decoder is only accessing the data once the
 * receiver is finished working with it. The only items that really need to be volatile
 * are some of the flags. However making the buffer volatile does not seem to measurably
 * slowdown the decoding process (I ran some tests). So as part of "good programming
 * practices we are marking the buffers and lengths as volatile just in case. We need not
 * use atomic blocks to access the buffer except in very rare cases.
