 * This module implements the original IRrecv receiver class which uses the 50us
 * interrupt timer to poll the input pin. While this is generally accurate enough for
 * everyday purposes, it may be difficult to port to other hardware unless you know a lot
 * about hardware timers and interrupts. Also when trying to analyze unknown protocols, 
 * the 50us granularity may not be sufficient. In that case use either the IRrecvLoop or 
 * the IRrecvPCI class.
