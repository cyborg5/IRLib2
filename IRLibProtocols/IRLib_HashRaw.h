/*
 * If you have a protocol which is unsupported by this library, you can still receive
 * and transmit the data. You can store the raw data values in a buffer and retransmit the 
 * data exactly as you received it. Of course it takes a lot of memory to store such data
 * so it is inefficient but it is better than nothing.
 * If all you need to do is detect a unique value for an unsupported protocol and you do
 * not need to resend the data, you can use the hash code decoder. It looks at the
 * array of raw timing values and create a 32 bit value based on the data. It is
 * highly likely to be unique however you cannot reverse engineer the process.
 * You cannot re-create the original data stream for 32 bit hash code. 
 * This module also implements the raw send method. You have to have the original
 * timing values.
